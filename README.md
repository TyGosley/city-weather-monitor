# City Weather Monitor

## User Story
AS A traveler

I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities

SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs

WHEN I search for a city

THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history

WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city

THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed

WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city

THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity

WHEN I click on a city in the search history

THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

## Description

The City Weather Monitor will help users find a major city's current weather as well as a 5 day forecast.  The weather will display the date, the temperature, wind, and humidity.  Each search creates a history button that can be clicked to see your previously searched city's weather.

This project was my hardest to date.  It has taught me how important API's and their functionality are.  Not only did this project show me some of my weakness, I learned more valuable ways to code better for future projects(this was not it).  Organization, comments, and coding smaller bits at a time are going to help me in the futre.
